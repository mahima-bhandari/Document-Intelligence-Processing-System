# Document Intelligence Processing System

## Overview
The **Document Intelligence Processing System** is an interactive web application developed using **Streamlit** that extracts, processes, and analyzes content from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. It leverages state-of-the-art models from **Hugging Face Transformers** for tasks such as **image captioning**, **text summarization**, and **sentiment analysis**. Additionally, it uses **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** to convert extracted text into audio. This system is ideal for processing documents and gaining insights quickly and efficiently.

## Features
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
- **Image Captioning**: Generates captions for images within PDF and DOCX files using an image-to-text model.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes long text documents using the BART model.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the extracted text (positive/negative/neutral).
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the extracted text into audio using Google TTS.
